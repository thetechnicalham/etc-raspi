The base WINE applications have been installed to support a future
installation of Windows programs such as VARA HF, VARA FM, and VARA
Terminal. However, these applications can't be installed within this
session of Cubic. They must be installed on a running version of 
EmComm Tools Community via a desktop session.

If you previously made a backup copy of your WINE installation using
the "$HOME/add-ons/wine/05-backup-wine-install.sh" script and would 
like to bake it into this ISO image, perform the following:

1. Change into the skeleton directory now with:

   cd /etc/skel

2. Copy your etc-wine-backup-*.tar.gz file using Cubic to this 
   directory.

3. Restore the backup into this directory with:

   tar -xzf etc-wine-backup-*.tar.gz

4. Confirm that you see a `.wine32` directory here.

5. Delete the compressed backup file to reduce the size of the 
   final image.

   rm etc-wine-backup-*.tar.gz
