# Offline Site Recommendations

This is a list of online resources that I personally store locally
for offline browsing. This list will grow over time.

Run `et-mirror.sh <start_url>` to mirror the site. For example:

```
et-mirror.sh https://choisser.com/packet/`
```

The above command will mirror the start URL https://choisser.com/packet/
along with any pages within the site that it links to.

The mirrored site will be available in your home directory under the
`offline-www` directory. You can open the files using the Min web browser.
